# The Typing Exercise

#### Why? 
Programming is still based on typing. It is very difficult to think about programming syntax, if you are wrestling with where to find symbols on the keyboard. The skill of typing develops gradually if you use the computer for an extended period of time - but this progress can be fastened considerably, if you put **conscious effort** into it, which you will help you in **MANY AREAS** of your **professional** and **private life**.

#### Exercise for the semester

I would like you to  
1. go to [https://keybr.com/](https://keybr.com/),  
2. register an account,  
3. and develop a habit to practice **every day** for 2-10 minutes.
