We discussed the principles of vectorization: the examples written during class are here: [`vectorization.R`]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/data/2025/vectorization.R)

Exercise during class:
- [Are functions vectorized?](https://adamtkocsis.com/rkheion/Exercises/2024-01-01_vectorized_prediction.html) - Paste code into the console with vector arguments to see the solutions!
