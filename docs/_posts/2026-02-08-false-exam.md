## Instructions

- Finish the exercise, preferably within 1.5/2 hours!
- You can use everything, except **your peers** and **large language models** (LLMs such as ChatGPT). 

<div style="background: rgba(247, 126, 126, 0.2); border-left: 4px solid #dd2e2e; border-radius: 4px; box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.12), 0 3px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.08); padding: 0.8rem;" markdown="1">
Note that this is not because we are luddites: AI tools can be great for increasing output volume, but they interfere with acquiring basic knowledge - which you need to **develop your creativity** to solve more complex problems and **think critically** about solutions. 
</div>

 Since there is no way how we can control this I expect you to be honest about the matter. Since google now defaults to using and AI overview, you can use a similar search engine such as [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/)

- The grades will not be registered, but you will get feedback on your solutions. 
- Please submit your code file with your name in it to this FAU-box link: [Upload assignments](https://faubox.rrze.uni-erlangen.de/preparefilelink?folderID=2BLgD1PZDge9PyqCmrx5f)!
