# About

- The material from last week is now added to the [r-kheion](https://adamkocsis.github.io/rkheion/2_Advanced_Beginner/02_types_and_variables/special_values.html).  
- November 1 is public holiday, so there won't be a lecture. We will continue with the new material next week.
- In the meantime, I invite you to do some of the exercises that I added to the website (see below).
