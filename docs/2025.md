#### About the pseudo-exam (scheduled for February 2 10:15):
- You will get an analysis exercise similar to [these](https://adamtkocsis.com/rkheion/2_Advanced_Beginner/20_summary/summary_level_2.html).
- You have to solve it on your own within two hours. You can use everything excluding your peers!
- If you cannot do it, then you will have to re-take the 'exam' until you pass it!
