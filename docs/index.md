## About

This webpage contains material that is taught at the **Consolidation of R programming skills** course at the *Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen- Nürnberg (FAU)*. The course is tied together with the international Paleobiology program at the FAU. 

More information about the course can be found at [palaeobiology.nat.fau.de](https://palaeobiology.nat.fau.de/program/courses/rcourse/). 

## Material

The course is building on some basic knowledge of computers and R. For totally uninitiated, it is recommended to go through the [Computers in Geosciences](https://adamkocsis.github.io/computers_in_geosciences/) course first. 

The material itself is integrated into the [*R-kheion*](https://adamkocsis.github.io/rkheion/), a continuously-developed comprehensive online R course. Both study and exercise material can be found there.
