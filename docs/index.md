## Material

This page is used to keep track of our progress through the semester.

The material itself will primarily be a part of Adam's currently written [Comprehensive R course](https://adamkocsis.github.io/rcourse/).
Both study and exercise material can be found there. 

## The test

The course can only be passed. But you will continue to exercise as long as it needs to get the fundamentals settled in.
